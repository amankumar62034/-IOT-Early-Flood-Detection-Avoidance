Methodology
Dams are crucial for irrigation, power generation, and flood control. Despite their role in flood management, many dams rely on manual methods to monitor water levels, leading to potential errors and risks. This project automates flood control using an Arduino UNO and a combination of sensors to manage water levels and prevent overflow.

Key Features
Water Level Monitoring: An ultrasonic sensor measures the water level. If it exceeds 95% of the damâ€™s capacity, a servo motor-operated gate releases excess water.
Flood Alerts: A float sensor in a river model detects high water levels, triggering a buzzer and SMS alerts via a GSM module.
Environmental Monitoring: An LM-35 temperature sensor measures temperature, and a moisture sensor gauges soil water holding capacity.
Rainfall Prediction: Machine learning predicts the next day's rainfall to adjust water levels proactively.

Components
Arduino UNO: Central microcontroller.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures water level.
Servo Motor: Controls the dam gate.
LM-35 Temperature Sensor: Measures temperature.
